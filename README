PROJECT PURPOSE:
    
    1. To re-develope the 3D Monte-Carlo (MC) solver using 3D structured grids, which can be used to solve Phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (PBTE) and was developed 6 years ago.  Some better schemes, which were developed during the development of the MC solver using 3D unstructured grids, will be applied on this version.
    
    2. To test another time-marching scheme, which is usually used in MC simulations of electron transport.

STATUS (04/24/2014):
    
    FINISHED:

        Currently, it can be used to solve transient problems under single material without nano-structure and with adiabatic and perodic BCs.
        
    FUTURE WORK:
        
        1. Implement another time-marching scheme.
        
        2. Add heat control module to enable heat flux flows through the material from external heat reservoir.
