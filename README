PROJECT PURPOSE:
    
    1. Re-develope the 3D Monte-Carlo (MC) solver, using 3D structured, for Phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (PBTE) applying better schemes, which were developed during the development of the MC solver for 3D unstructured grids.
    
    2. Test another time-marching scheme, which is usually used in MC simulations of electrons.

STATUS (04/24/2014):
    
    FINISHED:

        Currently, it can be used to solve transient problems under single material without nano-structure and with adiabatic and perodic BCs.
        
    FUTURE WORK:
        
        Implement another time-marching scheme.
